## About me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>


My wife and I moved to France from London with our five young children in 1994.  In London we were owners and directors of various companies, in finance and also in wine, manufacturing and construction industries.  We were in search of a quieter life in which to bring up our children, however, by taking up a previous teaching diploma, I became an English teacher teaching all levels and ages.  For the last 17 years I’ve taught classes at the [University de Savoie](https://www.univ-smb.fr/en), which have included TOEIC preparation, and through kholles, or colles, in the Preparatory class (cram school) at [Lycée Berthollet](http://www.ac-grenoble.fr/lycee/berthollet.annecy/).  Since 2011 I’ve increased my teaching extensively in numerous companies and in doing translations, translating at solicitor’s offices and live translations at court.
