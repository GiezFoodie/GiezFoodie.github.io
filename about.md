## About me

My wife and I moved to France from London with our five young children in 1994.  In London we were owners and directors of various companies.  We were in search of a quieter life in which to bring up our children. From that period I began turning countless recipes pages to find my personnel favorite recipes that I wished to cheer with everyone, but specifically my family.
