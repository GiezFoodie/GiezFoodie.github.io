# Beetroot Risotto
<em>For 4 portions</em>.

## Ingredients

- 500g beetroots cooked
- 1 litre water
- 2 chicken stock cubes
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 300g rice for risotto
- 120g red wine
- 3 tbls olive oil
- 2 tbls fresh thyme, only the leaves (or 1tbls dried)
- lemon juice, of 1 lemon
- lemon zest, of 1 lemon
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 pinch granulated sugar
- 3/4 tsp salt 
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 75g Parmesan cheese

## Method

- Place a deep pot over a medium heat; add 1 litre of water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes and heat until the cubes dissolve completely.
- Reserve the juices from the boiled beetroots
- Beat ½ of the beetroots with a ladleful of warm broth in a food processor, until the mixture is completely smooth.
- Add the beetroot puree to the broth in the pot.
- Turn off the heat.
- Cut the remaining beetroots into cubes and transfer to a bowl.
- Place a deep pot over medium to high heat. Add 3 tablespoons of olive oil.
- Finely chop the onion and add them to the pot along with some finely chopped thyme leaves. Stir with a wooden spoon.
- Add salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar. Stir often until the onion caramelizes, making sure it doesn’t stick to the pot.
- Add the rice. Sauté while stirring, until it becomes slightly translucent. As soon as it does, add the red wine and stir until it reduces and all of the alcohol has evaporated.
- Lower the heat and add 2 spoonfuls of stock. Stir continuously, careful not to let the rice stick to the bottom of the pot.
- As soon as the risotto has soaked up all of the moisture, add another spoonful of stock.
- Repeat this process until all of the broth has been added and the rice is ready.
- It is better if the rice is a little al dente and not completely boiled.
- Remove from heat and add butter, grated parmesan and lemon juice and lemon zest.
- Stir until the risotto is nice and creamy.
- Add the beetroot cubes and gently combine
